      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>
        This is a bio for the rock band <b>CONDITIONER</b>. Having not written a
        bio, they opted instead to use this paragraph of text for the purposes
        of filling up website space. You see, website space needed to be filled
        to give the illusion of content. Which is the same thing an artist bio
        does: fill up space and give the impression of importance. We are going
        to take a pause here for a picture.

      <p>
        <b>CONDITIONER</b> of course are back after the picture, this time to
        talk about their accolades and the cool things they have done.
        Interesting touring bands they've opened for. Places they've been and
        things they've seen. You look for bands you're familiar with but nothing
        rings a bell.
